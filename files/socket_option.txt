	int
	CAP_NET_ADMIN
	sk->sk_sndbuf
	sk->sk_write_space: 唤醒进程通知有更多的send缓冲区
	SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF < sk->sk_sndbuf : 无上限值

12. SO_KEEPALIVE

	TCP: sk->sk_timer  tp->keepalive_time[sysctl_tcp_keepalive_time]
13. SO_OOBINLINE
	bool int
	sk->sk_flags |= SOCK_URGINLINE
	If this option is enabled, out-of-band data is directly placed
    into the receive data stream.  Otherwise, out-of-band data is
    passed only when the MSG_OOB flag is set during receiving.
14. SO_NO_CHECK
	bool int
	sk->sk_no_check
15. SO_PRIORITY
	int
	sk->sk_priority
	Set the protocol-defined priority for all packets to be sent
    on this socket.  Linux uses this value to order the networking
    queues: packets with a higher priority may be processed first
    depending on the selected device queueing discipline.  Setting
    a priority outside the range 0 to 6 requires the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability.
16. SO_LINGER

	sock->flags |= SOCK_PASSSEC
	未知
28. SO_MARK [since Linux 2.6.25]
	CAP_NET_ADMIN
	int
	sk->sk_mark
	Set the mark for each packet sent through this socket (similar
    to the netfilter MARK target but socket-based).  Changing the
    mark can be used for mark-based routing without netfilter or
    for packet filtering.
29. SO_PEERCRED
	struct ucred
	sk->sk_peercred
	ONLY Getsock
	读取peer的权限
30. SO_PEERNAME
	char *
	sock->ops->getname()
	Only Getsock[Read Only]
31. SO_ACCEPTCONN
	int
	Only Getsock[Read Only]
	Returns a value indicating whether or not this socket has been
		marked to accept connections with listen(2).  The value 0
        indicates that this is not a listening socket, the value 1
        indicates that this is a listening socket.  
32. SO_PROTOCOL[since Linux 2.6.32]
	int
	Read Only
33. SO_PEEK_OFF [since Linux 3.4]
	int
	MSG_PEEK 相关
	The following example serves to illustrate the use of
        SO_PEEK_OFF.  Suppose a stream socket has the following queued
        input data:
            aabbccddeeff
        The following sequence of recv(2) calls would have the effect
        noted in the comments:
        int ov = 4;                  // Set peek offset to 4
        setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEEK_OFF, &ov, sizeof(ov));
        recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "cc"; offset set to 6
        recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "dd"; offset set to 8
        recv(fd, buf, 2, 0);         // Reads "aa"; offset set to 6
        recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "ee"; offset set to 8

34. SO_REUSEPORT[since Linux 3.9]
	int
	Permits multiple AF_INET or AF_INET6 sockets to be bound to an
		identical socket address.  This option must be set on each
        socket (including the first socket) prior to calling bind(2)
        on the socket.  To prevent port hijacking, all of the
        processes binding to the same address must have the same
        effective UID.  This option can be employed with both TCP and
        UDP sockets.
    For TCP sockets, this option allows accept(2) load
              distribution in a multi-threaded server to be improved by
              using a distinct listener socket for each thread.  This
              provides improved load distribution as compared to traditional
              techniques such using a single accept(2)ing thread that
              distributes connections, or having multiple threads that
              compete to accept(2) from the same socket.

              For UDP sockets, the use of this option can provide better
              distribution of incoming datagrams to multiple processes (or
              threads) as compared to the traditional technique of having
              multiple processes compete to receive datagrams on the same
              socket.
35. SO_RXQ_OVFL [since Linux 2.6.33]
	Indicates that an unsigned 32-bit value ancillary message
              (cmsg) should be attached to received skbs indicating the
              number of packets dropped by the socket between the last
              received packet and this received packet.

36. SO_BUSY_POLL [since Linux 3.11]
	Sets the approximate time in microseconds to busy poll on a
              blocking receive when there is no data.  Increasing this value
              requires CAP_NET_ADMIN.  The default for this option is
              controlled by the /proc/sys/net/core/busy_read file.

              The value in the /proc/sys/net/core/busy_poll file determines
              how long select(2) and poll(2) will busy poll when they
              operate on sockets with SO_BUSY_POLL set and no events to
              report are found.

              In both cases, busy polling will only be done when the socket
              last received data from a network device that supports this
              option.

              While busy polling may improve latency of some applications,
              care must be taken when using it since this will increase both
              CPU utilization and power usage.
